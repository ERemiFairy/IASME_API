	2. The new units generally ask us to change the password on login, however if not we would go into System Maintenance / Administrator Password to change it. We change it to a complex, secure password and save and re-login to the router to ensure thats worked properly.
	3. We finally update the documentation in IT. Firewall passwords are never made available outside of IT.
